# Exercise 5: Building on top of WebdriverIO

## Add a custom service

Add a custom service as explained [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/customservices.html) by using the `./custom-service.js` file.\
The file has already been imported in `wdio.conf.js` but you will still have to add the service to the services list.\
Tip: when using an imported service you have to surround the service with a array and pass a options object as the second item as shown in the documentation\

## Add a custom reporter

Add a custom reporter as explained [here](https://webdriver.io/docs/customreporter.html) by using the `./custom-reporter.js` file.
The file has already been imported in `wdio.conf.js` but you will still have to add the reporter to the reporters list.\
Tip: when using an imported reporter you have to surround the reporter with a array and pass a options object as the second item as shown in the documentation\
