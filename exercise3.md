# Exercise 3: Test TODO app

In the tests directory is a file called todo.spec.js in which you'll find some scenario's to be implemented. Use the todo.page.js to create a page object to be used in your tests. The exercises can be found in the todo.spec.js file marked as #1 #2, etc

NOTE: for each step, remove the `.skip` from the scenario and run `npm test` to check if the test works as expected
NOTE: you can add `.only` to a scenario to run only that specific scenario

## Step 1

- Complete the `open` method, found in the page object example [test/pages/todo.page.js](test/pages/todo.page.js)

## Step 2

- Implement the `create todo` scenario, found in the test file [test/specs/todo.spec.js](test/specs/todo.spec.js)

## Step 3

- Implement the `edit todo` scenario, found in the test file [test/specs/todo.spec.js](test/specs/todo.spec.js)

## Step 4

- Implement the `delete todo` scenario, found in the test file [test/specs/todo.spec.js](test/specs/todo.spec.js)

## Step 5

- Implement the `complete one todo` scenario, found in the test file [test/specs/todo.spec.js](test/specs/todo.spec.js)

## Step 6

- Implement the `show active/completed todos` scenario, found in the test file [test/specs/todo.spec.js](test/specs/todo.spec.js)

## Step 7

- Implement the `complete all todos` scenario, found in the test file [test/specs/todo.spec.js](test/specs/todo.spec.js)

## Step 8
